### Chart.js common module for CIDRAM and phpMussel.

- *Chart.min.js* is taken directly from the *[chartjs/Chart.js](https://github.com/chartjs/Chart.js)*, unmodified.
- *_chartjs.html* is written for and used by CIDRAM/phpMussel to leverage Chart.js to generate pie charts for the front-end.
- Chart.js version included in this repository: "2.7.0".

#### *Legal/Licensing:*
- *[Chart.js](https://github.com/chartjs/Chart.js))* (and thus, the contents of *[this repository](https://github.com/Maikuolan/Chart.js-Common-Module)*) uses the *[MIT License](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).*

### How to install:
Module is installed via the CIDRAM/phpMussel front-end updates page (as for installing it via other means: the module likely won't be required outside of that context anyhow).
